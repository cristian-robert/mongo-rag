# MongoRAG SaaS Roadmap

## Vision

Multi-tenant AI chatbot SaaS powered by RAG. Customers sign up, upload documents, get an embeddable script tag, and install a chatbot on their website that answers questions grounded in their own data.

## Architecture

- **Next.js** — SaaS frontend, dashboard, marketing site
- **FastAPI** — Python AI backend (RAG ingestion, retrieval, chat)
- **Pydantic AI or LangChain** — RAG/agent orchestration (decision in #1)
- **MongoDB Atlas + Vector Search** — document storage and retrieval
- **Stripe** — subscriptions and billing
- **Embeddable widget** — lightweight JS bundle for customer websites

## Reference Implementation

**[coleam00/MongoDB-RAG-Agent](https://github.com/coleam00/MongoDB-RAG-Agent)** — a working RAG agent that we adapt and extend rather than building from scratch.

### What we reuse:
| Component | Source File | Value |
|---|---|---|
| Hybrid RRF search | `src/tools.py` | Concurrent vector + text search with Reciprocal Rank Fusion |
| Document ingestion | `src/ingestion/` | Docling HybridChunker + batch embedder (PDF, Word, PPT, Excel, HTML, MD) |
| Pluggable providers | `src/providers.py` | OpenAI, OpenRouter, Ollama, Gemini support |
| Agent pattern | `src/agent.py` | Pydantic AI agent with tool calling |
| MongoDB schema | Collections | `documents` + `chunks` with vector + text indexes |

### What we build on top:
- Multi-tenant isolation (`tenant_id` on every query)
- FastAPI HTTP API (reference repo is CLI-only)
- Authentication (NextAuth.js + API keys)
- Dashboard, billing, widget
- Conversation history, streaming SSE
- Production deployment
